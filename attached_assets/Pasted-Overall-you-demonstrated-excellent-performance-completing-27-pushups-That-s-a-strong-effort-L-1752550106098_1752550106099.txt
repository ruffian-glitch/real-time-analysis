Overall, you demonstrated excellent performance completing **27 pushups**! That's a strong effort. Let's break down your form based on the data: * **Full Extension at the Top:** For the vast majority of your reps (Reps 2-27), you achieved very good to near-full elbow extension at the top of the movement, which indicates strong lockout and engagement of your chest and triceps. Rep 1 was slightly less extended, but you quickly corrected this. * **Depth at the Bottom:** You showed great depth for most of your pushups, consistently getting your elbows to angles typically below 47 degrees. This indicates you were bringing your chest close to the ground, ensuring a good range of motion. * **Area for Improvement:** As you approached the end of your set, specifically from **Rep 22 to Rep 26**, your depth started to decrease, with your elbows not bending as much. Rep 25, in particular, was quite shallow (minimum elbow angle of 65.5 degrees). Focus on maintaining that consistent depth throughout your entire set, especially as fatigue sets in. * **Body Alignment (Plank Position):** For the first 10 reps, you maintained a very strong and stable body alignment, indicated by your body angle at the bottom of the movement remaining consistently in the 150s. This shows great core strength and a straight line from head to heels. * **Area for Improvement:** From **Rep 11 onwards**, your body angle at the bottom started to consistently drop into the 130s and low 140s. This suggests that your core stability might have decreased as you got tired, potentially causing your hips to sag or pike slightly. Focus on keeping your core engaged and maintaining a straight line throughout your body, especially during the later reps. **To improve:** * Pay close attention to your body alignment from Rep 11 onwards, focusing on keeping a rigid plank. * Consciously strive to maintain your full depth, especially in the last few reps. It might be better to reduce the total number of reps slightly if it means maintaining perfect form throughout. Keep up the great work!
